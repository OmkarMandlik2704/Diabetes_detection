# Diabetes_detection
A machine learning project using a Decision Tree Classifier to predict diabetes based on medical attributes. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using accuracy, mean absolute error, and classification reports. The model helps analyze how factors like glucose levels, BMI, and age impact diabetes risk.
